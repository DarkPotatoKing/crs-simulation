# crs-simulation
A simulation program for CRS pre-enlistment module. The program will try to predict what subjects you will get after the batch run.

To run the program, use the Makefile (enter 'make') or run main.py ('python main.py') in command line. Make sure to read the tutorial carefully, the program isn't that "smart" yet, so you have to be careful with your inputs.
